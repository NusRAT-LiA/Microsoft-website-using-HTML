# Microsoft-website-using-HTML
I tried to make a webpage design for Microsft for black friday  and embedded some webpages creating a website. This webpage is made utilizing semantics and metatags for a better performance in browsers' searching .

I have also used ## OPEN-GRAPH-PROTOCOL that improves the user experience of shared links in social media platforms.

By clicking on "Sign up" button , you are directed to a sign up form also prepared using HTML.

The Sign Up page uses required fields and respective input tables and imposes limit on certain input types as a form of client side verification.
